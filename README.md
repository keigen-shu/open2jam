open2jam
========
open source emulator of [O2Jam](http://o2jam.wikia.com/wiki/O2Jam).

It is written in a combination of java, OpenGL and FMOD Ex, with the objective of being able to play in whatever platform you are.

We don't have an official roadmap, but we aim to:

*   Have it working on major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
*   Being able to play any OJN/OJM and BMS files.
*   Skinnable game interface
*   Multiplayer similar to o2jam.
